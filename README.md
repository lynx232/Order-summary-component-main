## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Variables
- Mobile-first workflow
- Modern Reset - Josh's Custom CSS Reset (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
- Box Shadows - (https://box-shadow.dev/)

### What I learned

Honed my skills regarding using the "background" function.

### Continued development

Still feel like I haven't been able to master importing .svg images using "background". Case in point, my page doesn't look exactly the same as the design files on all display sizes.
